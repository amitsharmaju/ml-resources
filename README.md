# ml-resources
This repo is a collection of resources to guide beginners in learning Machine Learning

NOTE: this project is a baby project. I would highly appreaciate it if you may contribute to it by posting a pull request with the specific resources you want to add.

This only includes technical resources; please do not forget to search for other meta-resources such as the ethics of Machine Learning, it's applications in real life, etc...
